# Research guidelines

## Research and citations

When citing sources, prioritize in this order:

1. Peer-reviewed journals (PubMed, PMC, DOI-linked articles)
2. Government/institutional databases (NCBI, FDA, USDA, WHO)
3. Professional society publications (AOCS, ACS)
4. Official standards bodies (Codex, ISO)

Avoid:

- Blog posts and hobbyist forums as primary sources
- Wikipedia (acceptable for orientation, not citation)
- Commercial sites with conflicts of interest
- Sources without clear authorship or publication date

For scientific claims, always prefer primary literature over secondary summaries.
